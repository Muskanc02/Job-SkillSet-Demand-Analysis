Somos una empresa en la que la sostenibilidad y el compromiso social son los pilares fundamentales. Contamos con m\u00e1s de 35.000 alumnos cada a\u00f1o y 12.000 convenios con empresa.\n\nHasta ahora nos hemos centrado principalmente en desarrollar un proceso de asesoramiento al alumno que ha permitido llegar a esos n\u00fameros, subcontratando a empresas de IT externas los desarrollos t\u00e9cnicos que hemos necesitado. Ahora estamos cambiando esta estrategia y desde 2023 estamos creando un equipo de Producto, Ingenier\u00eda y Datos interno que convierta a Northius en una EdTech con un producto digital propio y que nos permita relacionarnos con nuestros alumnos de un modo m\u00e1s cercano y escalable.\n\nContexto de negocio \n\nNorthius cuenta con +10 escuelas de formaci\u00f3n, cada una de ellas centrada en un sector laboral espec\u00edfico: CEAC , Deusto Formaci\u00f3n , Deusto Salud , Campus Training , Unisport , CEMP , Mint , CEAC FP , Tokio School , 35mm , Nubika , Flou , Wiikon y Vibe .\n\nEn 2019 entra en juego un fondo de inversi\u00f3n que consolida la expansi\u00f3n del grupo y permite alcanzar una facturaci\u00f3n de 100M en 2022 , contando con m\u00e1s de 40 delegaciones f\u00edsicas en Espa\u00f1a y Portugal y vendiendo nuestras formaciones en Europa y Latinoam\u00e9rica.\n\nNuestro compromiso va m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de los n\u00fameros porque, dentro de nuestros valores, la inclusi\u00f3n, diversidad e igualdad de oportunidades de las personas, ofertamos 1M\u20ac en becas para personas en situaci\u00f3n de desventaja social, formamos parte del Pacto Mundial de Naciones Unidas y estamos camino de convertirnos en empresa BCorp .\n\nChallenge: Convertir Northius en una compa\u00f1\u00eda EdTech \n\nA nivel de Producto Digital podr\u00edamos decir que tenemos todo por hacer. Hasta ahora, hemos invertido en los portales de las escuelas (Wordpress) , la plataforma de ventas (Salesforce) , en las plataformas de formaci\u00f3n (Moodle y DNN) y en la plataforma de facturaci\u00f3n (Business Central).\n\nSomos conscientes de que la relaci\u00f3n con nuestros alumnos tiene que ser m\u00e1s cercana y que tenemos que construir un portal para el alumno, para el profesor y para las empresas. De este modo, muchos de los procesos actuales podr\u00e1n ser automatizados y gestionados de manera aut\u00f3noma por los usuarios finales.\n\nEsto requiere de mucho trabajo de producto, entender los procesos actuales y proponer otros nuevos que mejoren la experiencia del alumno. Estamos haciendo crecer el equipo de Producto, Ingenier\u00eda y Datos que est\u00e1 construyendo este Producto Digital con un enfoque Lean . Dividimos nuestros Customer Journey en \u00e1reas, en cada una de ellas trabaja un squad multidisciplinar con personas de Producto (Product Manager, Product Designer), Ingenier\u00eda (Engineer Manager, FrontEnd, FullStack, BackEnd) y Datos (Data Analyst) que tienen uno o varios OKRs por trimestre y un KPI principal. Cada squad trabaja en el d\u00eda a d\u00eda con metodolog\u00edas \u00e1giles (Scrum, Sprints de 2 semanas) y tiene la autonom\u00eda para identificar problemas y proponer soluciones que mejoren su KPI y OKRs.\n\nUsamos Confluence, Miro, Figma y Slack para comunicarnos y documentar las iniciativas de producto en las que trabajamos. Disponemos de un Datalake en AWS que ingesta los datos de todos nuestros productos y QlikSense/QuickSight para construir dashboards que nos ayudan a tomar buenas decisiones basadas en datos\n\nStack tecnol\u00f3gico \n\nEn el equipo de Data disponemos de un Datalake montado sobre la nube de AWS, que ingesta los datos de nuestras plataformas y los transforma para ofrecer una capa de knowledge que permita visualizar los datos con facilidad y tomar decisiones con fiabilidad.\n\nEstructuramos los datos en tres capas (Bronze, Silver y Gold). Usamos Prefect para orquestar todos los procesos de extracci\u00f3n de datos y utilizamos DBT para definir los esquemas de datos de cada capa. Athena es la herramienta que nos permite acceder a estas capas usando SQL y mostramos los datos a nuestros stakeholders con Qlik Senses y con QuickSight .\n\nUsamos Terraform para gestionar la infraestructura en AWS y provee a los squads de producto de las herramientas de desarrollo y despliegue necesarias (Jira, Github, CI/CD, AWS EKS, Monitoring, Quality gates, E2E Test, Athena, Spark, Prefect, ...).3.\n\nNuestros valores \n\nSabemos Que Un Equipo Es M\u00e1s Que La Suma De Sus Miembros y Que Para Formar Un Equipo De Alto Rendimiento Es Necesario Que Las Personas Colaboren De Manera Eficaz.

We are eager to learn other languages or technologies. We area autonomous to make decisions. We always ask for business context whener it is needed to fully understand the business goal to achieve.\n\nAdding value to our product over adding value to our tech stack\n\nWe follow the product vision. We always have business needs in mind. We try to find the simplest reliable solution to solve business problems. We keep the technical debt as low as possible. We make decisions based on data.\n\nRock solid over Rock star\n\nWe are humble. We always try to understand first. We try to achieve consensus with our mates. We think before we speak (True, Helpful, Inspiring, Necessary and Kind). We like to collobarate instead of doing it alone. We share our knowledge. We win and lose as a team.\n\nIn production over \"my part is done\"\n\nWe are the owners of our deliveries. We measure the impact of our contributions. We are using data and monitoring to check that the deployment is working as expected. We help our mates to achieve the teams goals. We deliver fast in small pieces.\n\nProblem solvers over problem risers\n\nWe think on potential solutions when we find an issue. We left the place where we are working better than we found it.
