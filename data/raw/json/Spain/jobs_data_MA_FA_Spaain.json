        "description": "About the job\nI Department Overview\n\nIn many respects, banking is the business of managing risks.\n\nAt BNP Paribas, our well-developed risk management culture is based on a long-term perspective, a committed management, and a strong and independent risk organisation led by RISK.\n\nCreated at the same time as BNP Paribas, RISK is today a global function present in five continents and at the forefront of risk management through best-in-class expertise.\n\nRISK is an integrated and independent function and is part of BNP Paribas's control functions.\n\nIt is the independent second line of defence on the risk management activities of the Group which are under its direct responsibilities, including credit and counterparty risk, market risk, funding and liquidity risk, interest rate and foreign exchange risks in the banking book, insurance risk, operational risk and environmental and social risks.\n\nRISK aims at being a partner of the businesses by contributing to their sustainable development, but also a gatekeeper to ensure risks taken remain compatible with the Group\u2019s Risk Appetite and its strategy. RISK teams engage in an upstream dialogue with businesses to better understand their strategy, objectives and then they express their opinions and recommendations.\n\nII Job Description\n\nWe currently look for a MODEL RISK AND MODEL VALIDATION ANALYST.\n\nRISK Independent Review & Control (RISK IRC) is a special unit within the RISK organisation and reports directly to the Group CRO.

These models cover all asset classes and all products, whether securities or derivatives, including also the market risk management of CVA and funding value adjustment.\n On the counterparty risk side, the Group has developed Potential Future Exposure (PFE), Effective Expected Positive Exposure (EEPE) and CVA Capital Charge measures for various OTC, listed derivatives, prime brokerage and repo trading activities. The bank has implemented also the new Standardised Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) metric. Furthermore, the Group has developed and uses various types of margining methodologies, like the standard initial margin model (SIMM) used for non-centrally cleared derivatives.\n On the valuation risk front, various methodologies are used for fair value and prudent value adjustments. These valuation risk methodologies cover amongst others measures for market price uncertainty, for close-out costs, for model risk, for concentrated positions and for future administrative costs.\n\n\nSound model risk management practices require that these market risk, counterparty risk and valuation risk metrics, and any new developments, are subject to various types and levels of independent reviews, assessing the conceptual soundness, the proper application and the limitations of these methodologies. The vision of the team is to use the mean of proactive model risk management in order to enable better decisions where decisions rely on model outputs. We have built a franchise of model risk management services advising senior management, supervisory authorities, as well as serving internal clients requiring model risk assessments for existing or new models.\n\nThe position in subject is about the model risk management of the abovementioned types of methodologies, performing independent reviews, assessing model limitations, and advising the stakeholders about the level of model risk born by the use of these methodologies.

Model Risk Quantitative Analysts work mostly on independent reviews interacting with the validation managers and with the auditees. The latter usually includes model developers, teams operating the models, and model users. Those stakeholders may be within RISK, within the Business, or within other Group functions.\n\nRequired Hard Skills\n\nIII Professional Qualifications / Candidate Profile\n\n2 to 12 years of experience\nStrong quantitative background, owning an MSc or PhD degree in a quantitative subject, preferably a degree in financial mathematics.\nThis position requires proven professional experience in alignment with the responsibilities.\nAdvanced knowledge of capital markets: how the markets operate, what the liquidity and price observability of the key products are, what the trading venues are, and what the various netting and collateral agreements are.\nFamiliarity with many pricing models as well as with market and counterparty risk modelling techniques.\nStrong understanding of stochastic processes and derivatives pricing\nGood understanding of the regulatory requirements for the scope of models being in charge of.\nIn-depth knowledge of model risk management processes, regulatory requirements, internal policies, standards and templates.\nAdvanced programming skills in C++ / C# or other languages (R, Python, Matlab, etc) allowing fast assessment of model features and carrying out comparison of model alternatives.\nExperience with model validation techniques and model risk management processes.\n\n\nRequired Soft Skills\n\nStrong curiosity of the field, proactively seeking opportunity of learning and progress, and staying up-to-date with the newest developments in the field.\nBeing at ease with building relationships with people outside of the immediate team and seeking to understand diverse perspectives\nAbility to challenge the proposed methodologies and to provide alternative solutions.\nResult orientation, managing the time efficiently focusing on the mission and providing the highest quality work and precision under the constraint of given resources\nAbility to persuade and influence stakeholders\nEagerness to take ownership of projects and be autonomous in finding out the next steps.\nGenuine sense of care and respect for people, acting as a team player and proactively supporting colleagues.\n\n\nIV What We Offer\n\nWe offer the opportunity to work in a dynamic international environment where the candidate can learn about and work with cutting edge pricing and risk methodologies.\n\nThe position allows having a global view on the corporate and institutional banking activity of one of the market leading top tier investment banks.
